# Marketplace API — Homework 09: contract first

Chosen contract option: **B — runtime validation at the boundary**
(`express` + `express-openapi-validator`).

`openapi/openapi.yaml` is not documentation sitting next to the code — it is the
source of truth the validator checks **both requests and responses** against.
Anything that contradicts the spec does not cross the boundary: an invalid request
is rejected before it reaches a handler (400), and a response that has drifted away
from its schema never reaches the client (500 instead of silent drift).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | runs the app with the validator on port 3000 (`PORT=3001 npm start` for another port) |
| `npm run lint` | `redocly lint openapi/openapi.yaml` |
| `npm run bundle` | `redocly bundle openapi/openapi.yaml -o spec.json` |
| `npm run check` | every acceptance criterion for the spec (items 1–4) in one run |
| `npm run smoke` | every option B acceptance criterion plus the extra challenge, against the live app |

`npm run check` and `npm run smoke` perform exactly the same checks as the raw
commands below, just collected into one run with readable output.

## What the spec contains

**2 resources, 6 operations:**

| Operation | `operationId` |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /products` | `listProducts` |
| `POST /products` | `createProduct` |
| `GET /products/{productId}` | `getProduct` |
| `GET /orders` | `listOrders` |
| `POST /orders` | `createOrder` |
| `GET /orders/{orderId}` | `getOrder` |

* **Cursor pagination** on both list operations: query `limit` (1..100, default 20)
  and `cursor`. The response is `{ items, next_cursor }`, where `next_cursor: null`
  means there are no more pages. The cursor is opaque: the implementation happens to
  use base64url of `offset:<n>`, but that is an implementation detail and clients
  have no right to parse it.
* **Idempotency-Key** — a header parameter with `required: true` on both POST
  operations. It is `required: true` that lets the validator demand the header
  instead of an `if` in the code.
* **problem+json** — every 4xx/5xx response is served as `application/problem+json`
  with the `Problem` schema (`type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance`, all required).
* **Money is integer cents:** `price_cents`, `unit_price_cents`, `total_cents` are
  all `integer`. No floats and no decimal strings like `"2600.00"`.

The API deliberately has no authentication yet, so the root carries an explicit
`security: []` — without it the redocly `security-defined` rule raises an error and
`lint` exits with code 1.

## Verifying the acceptance criteria with raw commands

### 1. Spec is valid (exit code 0)

```bash
npx @redocly/cli lint openapi/openapi.yaml
echo $?   # 0
```

One warning (`no-server-example.com` for `http://localhost:3000`) is expected:
warnings are allowed, errors are not.

### 2. Spec size

```bash
npx @redocly/cli bundle openapi/openapi.yaml -o spec.json

node -e "const s=require('./spec.json'),M=['get','post','put','patch','delete'];\
const ops=Object.entries(s.paths).flatMap(([p,v])=>Object.keys(v).filter(m=>M.includes(m)).map(m=>[p,m]));\
const idem=ops.flatMap(([p,m])=>s.paths[p][m].parameters??[]).find(x=>x.in==='header'&&/idempotency-key/i.test(x.name));\
console.log('операцій:',ops.length,'· ресурсів:',new Set(Object.keys(s.paths).map(p=>p.split('/')[1])).size);\
console.log('Idempotency-Key: required =',idem?.required,'· опис, символів =',(idem?.description??'').trim().length)"
```

The `node -e` snippet is reproduced verbatim from the assignment, so its output
labels are in Ukrainian. Actual output:

```
операцій: 6 · ресурсів: 2
Idempotency-Key: required = true · опис, символів = 412
```

Parameters are written inline in the operations on purpose, rather than via
`$ref: '#/components/parameters/...'`: `redocly bundle` keeps `$ref`s in its output,
so the check above would have seen `{ $ref: ... }` instead of `in`/`name`/`required`.

### 3–5. Grep criteria

```bash
grep -c 'Idempotency-Key' openapi/openapi.yaml          # 8  (>= 1)
grep -c 'next_cursor' openapi/openapi.yaml              # 8  (>= 1)
grep -c 'application/problem+json' openapi/openapi.yaml # 7  (>= 2)
```

### 6. The contract part works (option B)

Start the server with `npm start`, then in another terminal:

**Without `Idempotency-Key` → 400 `application/problem+json`** (the header is demanded
by the spec, not by an `if` in the code):

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"p_1","qty":2}]}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{"type":"https://marketplace.example/problems/validation-error","title":"Bad Request",
 "status":400,"detail":"request/headers must have required property 'idempotency-key'",
 "instance":"/orders"}
```

The `detail` says `'idempotency-key'` in lowercase: the validator looks header
parameters up in `req.headers`, and Node lowercases header names. The spec itself
still spells the header the conventional way — `Idempotency-Key`.

**Invalid body (empty `items`) → 400 with a detail from the validator:**

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 6f1f8f4e-4d4b-4a53-9a0e-2c1f0b7a1c11' \
  -d '{"items":[]}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
detail: "request/body/items must NOT have fewer than 1 items"
```

**Valid request → 201:**

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 6f1f8f4e-4d4b-4a53-9a0e-2c1f0b7a1c11' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"p_1","qty":2}]}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{"id":"o_1","status":"created","currency":"UAH",
 "items":[{"product_id":"p_1","qty":2,"unit_price_cents":260000}],
 "total_cents":520000,"created_at":"..."}
```

## Extra challenge: full Idempotency-Key semantics

**Same key + same body → the same 201 plus `Idempotency-Replay: true`**
(no new order is created, the same `id` comes back):

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 6f1f8f4e-4d4b-4a53-9a0e-2c1f0b7a1c11' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"p_1","qty":2}]}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Idempotency-Replay: true
```

**Same key + a different body → 422 `application/problem+json`:**

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 6f1f8f4e-4d4b-4a53-9a0e-2c1f0b7a1c11' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"p_2","qty":9}]}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{"type":"https://marketplace.example/problems/idempotency-key-reuse",
 "title":"Unprocessable Entity","status":422,
 "detail":"Idempotency-Key '6f1f8f4e-...' was already used with a different request body.",
 "instance":"/orders"}
```

Request bodies are compared by their sha256 fingerprint, and keys are stored per
route (`POST /orders` and `POST /products` never collide with each other).

## Cursor pagination in action

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:3000/products?limit=3'
# {"items":[p_1,p_2,p_3],"next_cursor":"b2Zmc2V0OjM"}

curl -s 'localhost:3000/products?limit=3&cursor=b2Zmc2V0OjM'
# {"items":[p_4,p_5,p_6],"next_cursor":"b2Zmc2V0OjY"}

curl -s 'localhost:3000/products?limit=100'
# {"items":[...all 7...],"next_cursor":null}   ← no more pages
```

## Why `validateResponses: true`

A spec on its own enforces nothing. The boundary enforces it in both directions:

```js
OpenApiValidator.middleware({
  apiSpec: 'openapi/openapi.yaml',
  validateRequests: true,   // an invalid request never reaches a handler
  validateResponses: true,  // an invalid response never reaches the client
})
```

Verified against real drift: rename `total_cents` to `totalCents` in the
`POST /orders` handler — the classic refactoring slip — and the app no longer serves
an "almost correct" 201:

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
{"type":"https://marketplace.example/problems/internal-server-error",
 "title":"Internal Server Error","status":500,
 "detail":"/response must have required property 'total_cents'","instance":"/orders"}
```

This is the runtime counterpart of the lecture's `contract/check.mjs` that caught `DRIFT=1`.

## Layout

```
openapi/openapi.yaml   the spec: 2 resources, 6 operations, cursor pagination,
                       Idempotency-Key, problem+json
src/app.js             express app: the validator boundary plus handlers
src/server.js          entry point (npm start)
src/store.js           in-memory data, cursor, idempotency key storage
src/problem.js         error types and problem+json factories
scripts/check-spec.js  acceptance criteria for the spec (npm run check)
scripts/smoke.js       acceptance criteria for the app (npm run smoke)
```

## Versions

Pinned to the same versions the criteria were verified on:
`express@4.22.2`, `express-openapi-validator@5.6.2`, `@redocly/cli@2.46.0`.
`express@4` is deliberate — `express-openapi-validator` works with it without surprises.
`package.json` has no `"type": "module"`, so both the application code and the
`node -e "require('./spec.json')"` command from the criteria work as written.
